#This is a presentational website for logistics and transportation company ,,Tergo". They wanted modern and attractive website. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, PHP, JS. I used PHP because I wanted to reuse some components (navbar, map, footer..) without rewriting them all over again. As PHP is one of my stack languages, I found it the easiest to use it and reuse components with include()/require() statements.
